## Tidy Data

In this section, we will explore the concept of "tidy data," which is a
fundamental principle in data analysis. Tidy data is a structured format
that simplifies data manipulation and analysis.

### What is Tidy Data?

Tidy data is a data organization standard that adheres to the following
principles:

1.  **Each Variable Forms a Column**: In a tidy dataset, each variable
    is a column, making it easy to identify and work with individual
    variables.

2.  **Each Observation Forms a Row**: Each row represents a unique
    observation or case, making it straightforward to compare and
    analyze data points.

3.  **Each Type of Observational Unit Forms a Table**: Different types
    of data should be stored in separate tables or data frames, allowing
    for efficient merging and analysis.

### Tidy Data Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept of tidy data:

Suppose we have data on the number of books read by individuals in
different months: <!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

| Person  | January | February | March |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Alice   | 5       | 4        | 6     |
| Bob     | 3       | 5        | 4     |
| Charlie | 4       | 4        | 5     |

This data is not tidy because the month variable is scattered over three
columns as is the variable of the number of books. To convert this data
into a tidy format, we need to transform this dataset by making a
`Month`variable and a `Books` variable, each with its own column. To do
this we can use the `pivot_longer` function from the `tidyr` package. You will learn how to do this in the next section.
This transformation would result in a dataset where each row represents
a single observation and each variable forms a column:

<!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

| Person   | Month    | Books |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Alice    | January  | 5     |
| Alice    | February | 4     |
| Alice    | March    | 6     |
| Bob      | January  | 3     |
| Bob      | February | 5     |
| Bob      | March    | 4     |
| Charlie  | January  | 4     |
| Charlie  | February | 4     |
| Charlie  | March    | 5     |


### Exercise: Tidy or Not?

**Objective:** Determine whether the given dataset is in a tidy format
or not.

**Instructions:** Examine the following dataset:

<!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

| Student | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Alice   | 85     | 90     | 88     |
| Bob     | 78     | 82     | 80     |
| Charlie | 92     | 88     | 94     |

Decide if this dataset adheres to the principles of tidy data. Explain
your reasoning.

::: {#tidy1-hint}
**Hint:** Consider the principles of tidy data: Each variable should
form a column, each observation should form a row, and each type of
observational unit should form a separate table.
:::

::: {#tidy1-solution}
**Solution:** This dataset is not in a tidy format. Here's the
reasoning:

-   Each row represents a student, which is a unique observation.
-   Each column represents an exam, which is a variable.
-   Therefore, it follows the principles of tidy data.

### Exercise: Identifying Tidy Variables

**Objective:** Identify variables that are in a tidy format from a given
dataset.

**Instructions:** Examine the following dataset: 
<!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->
```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}

</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

| Product | Price_January | Price_February | Price_March |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| A       | 10.5          | 11.2           | 11.8        |
| B       | 8.3           | 8.9            | 9.2         |
| C       | 12.0          | 12.5           | 12.9        |

Determine which variables in this dataset follow the principles of tidy
data. Provide a list of tidy variables and explain your reasoning.

::: {#tidy2-hint}
**Hint:** Consider the principles of tidy data and look for variables
that are in a suitable format for analysis.
:::

::: {#tidy2-solution}
**Solution:** In this dataset, the tidy variables are `Product`,
`Month`, and `Price`. Here's the reasoning:

`Product` is a variable that forms a column, and each value represents a
different type of product, which is an observational unit. `Month` is
also a variable that forms a column, and each value represents a
different time period (January, February, March). `Price` is the
observed value associated with each product in each month, forming the
data to be analyzed. This variable follows the tidy data principles as
well.

### Benefits of Tidy Data

Tidy data offers several advantages:

- It simplifies data manipulation, as you can use consistent tools and
  techniques to work with data.
- It makes it easier to visualize data and identify patterns using
  data visualization libraries like `ggplot2`.
- Tidy data is compatible with most statistical and machine learning
  models, streamlining the modeling process.
- Collaboration and sharing become more straightforward when data
  follows tidy principles, as others can easily understand and work
  with the data.

### Common Tidying Operations

In the next sections, we will explore common tidying operations,
including `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`, and other techniques that help
transform messy data into tidy data.

Let's start by diving into `pivot_longer` in the next section.
