<h2>A Brief History of R</h2>
<div id="section-the-birth-of-r" class="section level3">
<h3>The Birth of R:</h3>
<p>R’s story is intimately tied to the history of the S programming
language. In the early 1970s, John Chambers and his colleagues at Bell
Laboratories developed S, a proprietary statistical programming
language. S revolutionized data analysis by introducing a structured and
powerful language for statistical computing. While S was groundbreaking,
it was a proprietary software, limiting its accessibility and
affordability. This led to the desire for an open-source alternative,
which ultimately gave birth to R. Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman’s work
in the early 1990s, which resulted in R, was heavily influenced by S.
Their goal was to develop a free, accessible alternative to the
expensive statistical software packages available at the time.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-open-source-roots" class="section level3">
<h3>Open-Source Roots:</h3>
<p>To accomplish the goal of free accessible software, R was developed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensuring it would remain
open and accessible to everyone. R’s open-source nature meant that
anyone could contribute to its development and use it for various
statistical and data analysis tasks. This openness quickly attracted a
community of statisticians, data scientists, and researchers who saw its
potential. Their collaborative approach led to rapid improvements, bug
fixes, and the creation of numerous packages that extended R’s
capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-legacy-of-s-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Legacy of S in R:</h3>
<p>Despite the transition to R, S’s legacy lives on within R. Many
concepts, functions, and syntax from S were integrated into R, making it
familiar to those who had experience with S. This ensured a relatively
smooth transition for statisticians and data analysts. As R gained
popularity and traction within the statistical and data science
communities, it had a notable impact on S. The success of R contributed
to the decline of S as a dominant statistical platform. It became clear
that open-source and community-driven development was the way forward in
the field of statistical computing.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-data-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
<p>Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It
involves transforming, cleaning, and reshaping raw data into a format
that is more suitable for analysis and visualization. Data wrangling
ensures that your data is in the right shape and structure to extract
meaningful insights effectively.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will explore data wrangling using Tidyverse, a
collection of R packages designed for data science that includes popular
packages like <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, and
<code>ggplot2</code>. Tidyverse provides a powerful and consistent set
of tools for data manipulation and visualization, making it a favorite
among data analysts and scientists.</p>
<p>The data wrangling process spans several steps of the data science
process, including consists of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import Data:</strong> Importing data from various sources,
such as files (CSV, Excel), databases, APIs, or web scraping.</li>
<li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Addressing missing or erroneous
data, handling duplicates, and converting data types to ensure
consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Reorganizing and restructuring
data, including tasks like filtering rows, selecting columns, creating
new variables, and reshaping data when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will dive into each of these steps and
demonstrate how Tidyverse’s tools can simplify and streamline the data
wrangling process, ultimately helping you derive valuable insights from
your data.</p>
<p>Are you ready to get started with data wrangling? Let’s begin!</p>

<div id="section-the-flavors-of-r" class="section level2">
<h2>The Flavors of R</h2>
<p>Welcome to this tutorial on base R and data frames! R has evolved and
improved rapidly over the years. R functions and coding from the early
days (90s) is known as base R. Even though we will be embracing the
tidyverse philosophy of R, bits of base R code shows up regularly in
examples, videos, and code generated by AI. Here is a brief introduction
to base R and how it compares to tidyverse so you know it when you see
it.</p>
<p>R offers several flavors or dialects that cater to different
preferences. The main flavors include “base R,” the “Tidyverse,” and
“data.table.” Base R is the default flavor when you first open R and has
a long-standing history. In contrast, the Tidyverse and data.table are
extensions accessed through packages. Each flavor has its strengths and
applications, and your choice often depends on the task at hand and
personal preferences.</p>
<div id="section-comparing-flavors" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing Flavors</h3>
<p>Some users have strong preferences for one flavor over another.
However, each flavor has its own merits. The choice between them depends
on the problem you’re solving and your personal style.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tidyverse emphasizes readability and flexibility, making it an
excellent choice for scalable and easily comprehensible code,
particularly when collaborating with others. It emphasizes efficient
data cleaning and manipulation capabilities with concise and practical
code.</p></li>
<li><p>data.table excels in speed and conciseness, allowing for rapid
development and efficient code execution, even with sizable
datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Base R is known for its stability, making it a suitable choice
for long-term projects. Additionally, it offers skills that are more
transferable to other programming languages.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-base-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Base R</h2>
<p>Here is a quick look at the syntax of base R:</p>
<div id="section-r-as-a-calculator" class="section level3">
<h3>R as a Calculator</h3>
<p>R can be used as a simple calculator. You can perform basic
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
2 + 3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>Variables In R, you can store values in variables. This allows you to
reuse and manipulate these values later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
x &lt;- 5
y &lt;- 3
x + y</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Frames</h3>
<p>A data frame is a fundamental data structure in base R. It is a
two-dimensional tabular data structure with rows and columns, much like
a spreadsheet.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
df &lt;- data.frame(
  Name = c(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;),
  Age = c(25, 30, 22),
  Score = c(85, 92, 78)
)

<div id="section-tidyverse" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidyverse</h2>
<p>Tidyverse, a powerful collection of R packages for data manipulation
and visualization. In this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of working
with Tidyverse, including tibbles (a modern data frame), how to view
data, summarize information, access columns, and access rows. Let’s dive
in!</p>
<div id="section-tibbles" class="section level3">
<h3>Tibbles</h3>
<p>In this section, we will explore tibbles, a modern data frame
structure in the tidyverse. Tibbles are a more user-friendly and
feature-rich alternative to the traditional data frames in R.</p>
<p>Tibbles are a type of data frame provided by the Tidyverse. They are
similar to traditional data frames in R but offer some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tibbles display data more neatly and consistently.</li>
<li>Column names are always treated as text.</li>
<li>Tibbles do not convert strings to factors by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go over the key characteristics of tibbles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Column Names</strong>: Tibbles preserve column names as they
are, without any modifications or coercion. This can be essential for
maintaining consistency in your data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Type Consistency</strong>: Tibbles are stricter about
preserving data types. Unlike data frames, tibbles won’t automatically
convert your variables to factors or character vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Printing</strong>: When you print a tibble to the console,
it only displays the first few rows and columns, making it easier to
explore large datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Subsetting</strong>: Tibbles use <code>[[</code> for
subsetting columns, which can be more intuitive and less prone to
errors.</li>
<li><strong>Row Names</strong>: Tibbles do not have row names. Instead,
they use a row number as a default identifier.</li>
</ol>
<div id="section-creating-tibbles" class="section level4">
<h4>Creating Tibbles</h4>
<p>You can create a tibble from an existing data frame or by directly
specifying its columns. Let’s see how to create a tibble:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating a tibble from a data frame
library(tibble)
df &lt;- data.frame(ID = 1:3, Name = c(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;))
tb &lt;- as_tibble(df)

# Creating a tibble from scratch
my_tibble &lt;- tibble(
  ID = c(101, 102, 103),
  Age = c(25, 30, 22),
  City = c(&quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;)
)
my_tibble</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["ID"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"101","2":"25","3":"New York"},{"1":"102","2":"30","3":"Los Angeles"},{"1":"103","2":"22","3":"Chicago"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-viewing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Viewing Data</h3>
<p>Now that we have created some tibbles, let’s explore their properties
and learn how to work with them.</p>
<div id="section-viewing-the-first-few-rows" class="section level5">
<h5>Viewing the First Few Rows</h5>
<p>You can use the <code>head()</code> function to view the first few
rows of a tibble:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># View the first 5 rows of my_tibble
head(my_tibble)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["ID"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"101","2":"25","3":"New York"},{"1":"102","2":"30","3":"Los Angeles"},{"1":"103","2":"22","3":"Chicago"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-viewing-the-last-few-rows" class="section level4">
<h4>Viewing the Last Few Rows</h4>
<p>Similarly, you can view the last few rows using the
<code>tail()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
tail(my_tibble)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["ID"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"101","2":"25","3":"New York"},{"1":"102","2":"30","3":"Los Angeles"},{"1":"103","2":"22","3":"Chicago"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-summary-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary Information</h3>
<div id="section-summary-of-the-tibble" class="section level4">
<h4>Summary of the tibble</h4>
<p>To get a summary of your tibble’s structure, you can use
<code>str()</code> or <code>glimpse()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Display summary information
str(my_tibble)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## tibble [3 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ ID  : num [1:3] 101 102 103
##  $ Age : num [1:3] 25 30 22
##  $ City: chr [1:3] &quot;New York&quot; &quot;Los Angeles&quot; &quot;Chicago&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>glimpse(my_tibble)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 3
## Columns: 3
## $ ID   &lt;dbl&gt; 101, 102, 103
## $ Age  &lt;dbl&gt; 25, 30, 22
## $ City &lt;chr&gt; &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-summary-of-data-in-a-tibble" class="section level4">
<h4>Summary of data in a tibble</h4>
<p>To get summary statistics for numerical columns, you can use the
<code>summary()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
summary(my_tibble$Age)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   22.00   23.50   25.00   25.67   27.50   30.00</code></pre>
<p>For categorical columns, you can use the <code>table()</code>
function to see the frequency of each category:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example:
table(my_tibble$City)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##     Chicago Los Angeles    New York 
##           1           1           1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-accessing-columns-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessing Columns</h3>
<p>Accessing columns in a tibble is straightforward using the
<code>$</code> operator:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Access the &#39;Age&#39; column
my_tibble$Age</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 25 30 22</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-accessing-rows-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessing Rows</h3>
<p>Accessing data in particular rows can be done using the
<code>filter()</code> function (more on this later):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Filter rows where Age is greater than 25
my_tibble %&gt;%
  filter(Age &gt; 25)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["ID"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Age"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"102","2":"30","3":"Los Angeles"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
