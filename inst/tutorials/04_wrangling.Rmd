## Data Wrangling

Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It
involves transforming, cleaning, and reshaping raw data into a format
that is more suitable for analysis and visualization. Data wrangling
ensures that your data is in the right shape and structure to extract
meaningful insights effectively.

In this tutorial, we will explore data wrangling using Tidyverse, a
collection of R packages designed for data science that includes popular
packages like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`. Tidyverse provides a
powerful and consistent set of tools for data manipulation and
visualization, making it a favorite among data analysts and scientists.

The data wrangling process spans several steps of the data science
process, including consists of the following steps:

-   **Import Data:** Importing data from various sources, such as files
    (CSV, Excel), databases, APIs, or web scraping.
-   **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing or erroneous data, handling
    duplicates, and converting data types to ensure consistency.
-   **Data Transformation:** Reorganizing and restructuring data,
    including tasks like filtering rows, selecting columns, creating new
    variables, and reshaping data when needed.

Throughout this tutorial, we will dive into each of these steps and
demonstrate how Tidyverse's tools can simplify and streamline the data
wrangling process, ultimately helping you derive valuable insights from
your data.

Are you ready to get started with data wrangling? Let's begin!

## Tibbles

In this section, we will explore tibbles, a modern data frame structure
in the tidyverse. Tibbles are a more user-friendly and feature-rich
alternative to the traditional data frames in R.

### What is a Tibble?

A tibble is a data frame, but with some important differences. Let's go
over the key characteristics of tibbles:

1.  **Column Names**: Tibbles preserve column names as they are, without
    any modifications or coercion. This can be essential for maintaining
    consistency in your data.
2.  **Data Type Consistency**: Tibbles are stricter about preserving
    data types. Unlike data frames, tibbles won't automatically convert
    your variables to factors or character vectors.
3.  **Printing**: When you print a tibble to the console, it only
    displays the first few rows and columns, making it easier to explore
    large datasets.
4.  **Subsetting**: Tibbles use `[[` for subsetting columns, which can
    be more intuitive and less prone to errors.
5.  **Row Names**: Tibbles do not have row names. Instead, they use a
    row number as a default identifier.

### Creating Tibbles

You can create a tibble from an existing data frame or by directly
specifying its columns. Let's see how to create a tibble:

```{r echo=T}
# Creating a tibble from a data frame
library(tibble)
df <- data.frame(ID = 1:3, Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"))
tb <- as_tibble(df)

# Creating a tibble from scratch
my_tibble <- tibble(
  ID = c(101, 102, 103),
  Age = c(25, 30, 22),
  City = c("New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago")
)
```

### Exploring Tibbles

Now that we have created some tibbles, let's explore their properties
and learn how to work with them.

#### Viewing the First Few Rows

You can use the `head()` function to view the first few rows of a
tibble:

```{r echo=T}
# View the first 5 rows of my_tibble
head(my_tibble)
```

#### Summary Information

To get a summary of your tibble's structure, you can use `str()` or
`glimpse()`:

```{r echo =T}
# Display summary information
str(my_tibble)
glimpse(my_tibble)
```

#### Accessing Columns

Accessing columns in a tibble is straightforward using the `$` operator:

```{r echo=T}
# Access the 'Age' column
my_tibble$Age
```

#### Accessing Rows

Accessing data in particular rows can be done using the filter()
function (more on this later):

```{r echo=T}
# Filter rows where Age is greater than 25
my_tibble %>%
  filter(Age > 25)
```

In this section, we introduced tibbles, a crucial data structure in the
tidyverse. You learned about their key characteristics, how to create
tibbles, and basic operations to explore and manipulate tibble data. In
the next sections, we will dive deeper into data manipulation using
tibbles and other tidyverse tools.

## Tidy Data

In this section, we will explore the concept of "tidy data," which is a
fundamental principle in data analysis. Tidy data is a structured format
that simplifies data manipulation and analysis.

### What is Tidy Data?

Tidy data is a data organization standard that adheres to the following
principles:

1.  **Each Variable Forms a Column**: In a tidy dataset, each variable
    is a column, making it easy to identify and work with individual
    variables.

2.  **Each Observation Forms a Row**: Each row represents a unique
    observation or case, making it straightforward to compare and
    analyze data points.

3.  **Each Type of Observational Unit Forms a Table**: Different types
    of data should be stored in separate tables or data frames, allowing
    for efficient merging and analysis.

### Tidy Data Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept of tidy data:

Suppose we have data on the number of books read by individuals in
different months: <!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

+---------+---------+----------+-------+
| Person  | January | February | March |
+=========+=========+==========+=======+
| Alice   | 5       | 4        | 6     |
+---------+---------+----------+-------+
| Bob     | 3       | 5        | 4     |
+---------+---------+----------+-------+
| Charlie | 4       | 4        | 5     |
+---------+---------+----------+-------+

This data is not tidy because the month variable is scattered over three
columns as is the variable of the number of books. To convert this data
into a tidy format, we need to transform this dataset by making a
`Month`variable and a `Books` variable, each with its own column. To do
this we can use the `pivot_longer` function from the `tidyr` package.
This transformation would result in a dataset where each row represents
a single observation and each variable forms a column:

<!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

\### Benefits of Tidy Data

Tidy data offers several advantages:

-   It simplifies data manipulation, as you can use consistent tools and
    techniques to work with data.
-   It makes it easier to visualize data and identify patterns using
    data visualization libraries like `ggplot2`.
-   Tidy data is compatible with most statistical and machine learning
    models, streamlining the modeling process.
-   Collaboration and sharing become more straightforward when data
    follows tidy principles, as others can easily understand and work
    with the data.

### Common Tidying Operations

In the next sections, we will explore common tidying operations,
including `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`, and other techniques that help
transform messy data into tidy data.

Let's start by diving into `pivot_longer` in the next section.

Are you ready to explore tidying data with `tidyr`? Let's get started!

### Exercise: Tidy or Not?

**Objective:** Determine whether the given dataset is in a tidy format
or not.

**Instructions:**

Examine the following dataset:

<!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

+---------+--------+--------+--------+
| Student | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 |
+=========+========+========+========+
| Alice   | 85     | 90     | 88     |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+
| Bob     | 78     | 82     | 80     |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+
| Charlie | 92     | 88     | 94     |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+

Decide if this dataset adheres to the principles of tidy data. Explain
your reasoning.

::: {#tidy1-hint}
**Hint:** Consider the principles of tidy data: Each variable should
form a column, each observation should form a row, and each type of
observational unit should form a separate table.
:::

::: {#tidy1-solution}
**Solution:** This dataset is not in a tidy format. Here's the
reasoning:

-   Each row represents a student, which is a unique observation.
-   Each column represents an exam, which is a variable.
-   Therefore, it follows the principles of tidy data.

### Exercise: Identifying Tidy Variables

**Objective:** Identify variables that are in a tidy format from a given
dataset.

**Instructions:**

Examine the following dataset: <!-- Add CSS styling for the table -->

```{=html}
<style>
.custom-table {
    width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    text-align: center; /* Set the text alignment (center, left, right) */
    padding: 8px; /* Add padding for better spacing */
}

.custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Add a background color to table headers */
}
</style>
```
<!-- Define the table using standard Markdown -->

+---------+---------------+----------------+-------------+
| Product | Price_January | Price_February | Price_March |
+=========+===============+================+=============+
| A       | 10.5          | 11.2           | 11.8        |
+---------+---------------+----------------+-------------+
| B       | 8.3           | 8.9            | 9.2         |
+---------+---------------+----------------+-------------+
| C       | 12.0          | 12.5           | 12.9        |
+---------+---------------+----------------+-------------+

Determine which variables in this dataset follow the principles of tidy
data. Provide a list of tidy variables and explain your reasoning.

::: {#tidy2-hint}
**Hint:** Consider the principles of tidy data and look for variables
that are in a suitable format for analysis.
:::

::: {#tidy2-solution}
**Solution:** In this dataset, the tidy variables are `Product`,
`Month`, and `Price`. Here's the reasoning:

`Product` is a variable that forms a column, and each value represents a
different type of product, which is an observational unit. `Month` is
also a variable that forms a column, and each value represents a
different time period (January, February, March). `Price` is the
observed value associated with each product in each month, forming the
data to be analyzed. This variable follows the tidy data principles as
well.

## Transforming Rows

In this section, we will dive into techniques for basic data
transformation of rows of data. Remember that in tidy data, every row is
an observation of the data source. Typically, we transform rows of a
dataset (tibble) by filtering and arranging according to your analysis
needs

### Installing and Loading the Tidyverse Package

Before we start, let's ensure you have the tidyverse package installed
and loaded. If you haven't already installed it, run the following code:

```{r install_tidyverse}
# Install tidyverse (if not already installed)
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
```

Now, load the package:

```{r load_tidyverse}
# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)
```

### Importing Data into R

To demonstrate data transformation, we need some data. In this tutorial,
we'll generate a sample dataset of student scores called `student_data`.
It contains scores from math and literature classes.

Let's generate the `student_data` dataset:

```{r studata}
# Create a sample dataset for demonstration
(student_data <- tibble(
  Student = c("Abbie", "Billy", "Clara", "Danielle", "Edgar"),
  Math_Score = c(85, 92, 78, 95, 88),
  Literature_Score = c(88, 90, 75, 92, 86)
))
```

Generating the dataset means that it is loaded for us. Usually you will
need to import a dataset for your analytics.

### Filtering Rows with `filter()`

Here we will explore how to filter rows in your data using the
`filter()` function in Tidyverse. Think of this function as a verb that
allows you to select specific rows based on certain conditions.

#### Filtering Rows with Single Conditions

The `filter()` function is a powerful tool for selecting rows that meet
specific conditions. Let's start with simple examples using single
conditions.

##### Inequalities

Suppose we have a dataset of students' exam scores. To filter and select
students who scored **greater than** 90 in Math:
```{r filter1}
# Filter students with Math scores above 90
(high_math_scores <- student_data |>
  filter(Math_Score > 90))
```

Here, `Math_Score > 90` is a single condition that selects rows where
the `Math_Score` is greater than 90.

Ready to practice filtering rows using `filter()`? Try this exercise to
reinforce your knowledge!

##### **Exercise:** Filtering by Math Score

**Objective:** Filter students who scored below 80 in Math.

**Instructions:** Use the `filter()` function to create a new dataset,
`low_math_scores`, that includes students with Math scores less than 80.
```{r filter_low, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r filter_low-hint}
# Filter students with Math scores below 80
(low_math_scores <- student_data %>%
  filter(Math_Score < 80))
```


##### Equalities

We can also filter data to get a specific value rather than greater than
or less than. For example, to filter and select students whose score
**equal** exactly 90 in their literature class:

```{r echo=T}
# Filter students with Math scores above 90
(lit_scores_90 <- student_data |>
  filter(Literature_Score == 90))
```

Here, `Literature_Score == 90` is a single condition that selects rows
where the `Literature_Score` is equal to 90. Notice that the equality
condition is specified with `==` rather than `=`. More on this soon.

##### Character Strings

When we want to filter on a condition in a character variable, we simply
need to set the condition equal to a character string in quotes. For
example, to filter and select Edgar's scores: We can also filter data to
get a specific value rather than greater than or less than. For example,
to filter and select students whose score **equal** exactly 90 in their
literature class:

```{r echo=T}
# Filter students with Math scores above 90
(Edgar_scores <- student_data |>
  filter(Student == "Edgar"))
```

Here, `Student == "Edgar"` is a single condition that selects rows where
the student name is Edgar. Notice that once again the equality condition
is specified with `==` rather than `=`.

#### Filtering Rows with Multiple (Boolean) Conditions

You can also use boolean conditions to filter rows based on multiple
criteria. Boolean conditions, named after mathematician and logician
George Boole, are expressions or statements in programming that evaluate
to either true or false, representing logical values or states. More
specifically boolean conditions use logical operators such as & (AND),
\| (OR), and ! (NOT).

Suppose we want to filter students who scored above 90 in both Math and
Literature:

```{r echo=T}
# Filter students with scores above 90 in both Math and Literature
(high_scores_both <- student_data |>
  filter(Math_Score > 90 & Literature_Score > 90))
```

In this case, the condition `Math_Score > 90 & English_Score > 90` is a
boolean condition that selects rows where the Math score and the
Literature simultaneously meet the conditions.

#### Exercise 3: Filtering by Math and Literature Scores
__Objective:__ Filter students who scored above 90 in both Math and Literature.

__Instructions:__ Use the `filter()` function to create a new dataset, `high_scores_both`, that includes students with Math scores greater than 90 and Literature scores less than 90.
```{r filter_math_lit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r filter_math_lit-hint}
# Filter students with scores above 90 in both Math and below 90 in Literature
high_scores_both <- student_data %>%
  filter(Math_Score > 90 & Literature_Score < 90)
```

  
  
#### Filtering with the %in% Operator

The `%in%` operator is useful for filtering rows based on values within
a specified set or vector. As you probably expect, it is a condition
that selects when a condition is found **in** the data.

Suppose we have a dataset of customer orders, and we want to filter
orders from specific cities. First we need to generate this sample data:

```{r echo=T}
# Create a sample dataset for %in% demonstration
(orders_data <- tibble(
  Customer_ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
  Order_ID = c(101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110),
  Order_Quantity = c(5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 5),
  Date = as.Date(c("2023-01-10", "2023-02-15", "2023-03-20", "2023-04-25", "2023-05-30", 
                    "2023-06-05", "2023-07-10", "2023-08-15", "2023-09-20", "2023-10-25")),
  City = c("New York", "Los Angeles", "Boston", "Seattle", "Chicago", "San Francisco", 
    "Miami", "Denver", "Austin", "Atlanta")
))
```

Now let's filter on the orders in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles:

```{r echo=T}
# Filter orders from selected cities
selected_cities <- c("New York", "Chicago", "Los Angeles")
(filtered_orders <- orders_data %>%
  filter(City %in% selected_cities))
```

Here, `City %in% selected_cities` checks if the `City` values match any
of the selected cities in the vector named `selected_cities`.

#### Exercise: Filtering by Product Category
__Objective:__ Filter products from specific product categories.

__Instructions:__ Use the `filter()` function to create a new dataset, `selected_products`, that includes products from the categories "Electronics," "Clothing," and "Books."

_Dataset:_ Here's a sample dataset of products with product IDs and categories for use in this exercise:
```{r product_data}
# Sample dataset of products
(product_data <- tibble(
  Product_ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
  Product_Name = c("Laptop", "T-shirt", "Headphones", "Jeans", "Tablet",
                    "Dress", "Smartphone", "Sneakers", "Book", "Camera"),
  Category = c("Electronics", "Clothing", "Electronics", "Clothing", "Electronics",
               "Clothing", "Electronics", "Clothing", "Books", "Electronics")
  )
 )
```

```{r filter_in, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r filter_in-hint}
# Select products from specific categories
selected_categories <- c("Electronics", "Clothing", "Books")
selected_products <- product_data %>%
  filter(Category %in% selected_categories)
```

#### Distinction Between `=` and `==`

In R, `=` is used for assignment, while `==` is used for equality
comparison. When filtering rows based on values, always use `==`. For
example:

```{r}
# Correct: Filter rows where order quantity is equal to 103
filtered_data <- orders_data %>%
  filter(Order_Quantity == 103)

# Incorrect: Avoid using = for comparison. (This code will generate an error)
#filtered_data <- data %>%
#  filter(Age = 30) # This would make sense if age was being set to 30 but not in this comparison whether Age = 30
```

In this section, we've explored the filter() function in Tidyverse,
emphasizing its role as a verb that selects rows based on conditions. We
covered single conditions, boolean conditions, the %in% operator for set
matching, and the distinction between = and ==. Filtering is a
fundamental data wrangling skill that helps you extract meaningful
information from your datasets.
